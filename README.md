# TheSimpleBrowser
My Simple J2ME mobile app that helps me to enter the URL to browse through it in a Java mobile
Had difficulties accessing webpages by entering URLS in the phone I had, So created a J2ME mobile application that lets you enter a web url and access the web page.
This application also lets you save the URLs as bookmarks in the record based persistence that comes with J2ME.
Detailed documentation coming soon.
